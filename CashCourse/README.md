Problems: 

Initially, we explored several different ideas, each one vastly different from one another. We ended up spending a lot of our time brainstorming ideas and thoughts about each option before ultimately deciding on gamifying finance. Our challenges didn't stop there as the planning for this app changed numerous time throughout development of it. However, we rolled with the development and didn't let it halt our progress at all.

Designing the webpage of our application also was a challenge as we weren't sure of how to approach it and the styling and multiple components of our app made it difficult to get everything within its proper place

During development, a challenge arose when the code would not function the same on one team member's computer as it did on another's computer. After thorough troubleshooting and collaboration, we were able to identify the root cause of the issue and swiftly dealt with it to ensure a smooth collaboration across all environments going forward.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
